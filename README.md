# Rob Ó Ceallaigh
## Junior Web Developer | Frontend Developer


I'm a self motivated and creative person, so I decided to change my career and move into an area that I'm passionate about and allows me to utilise my creativity. I decided to take the initiative and retrained in Full Stack Web Development with Code Institute.


I am skilled in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, Flask, Django Github, Heroku and more. Since I have completed my study I am keeping my skills up to date with personal projects and building my programming knowledge and experience. I'm also currently getting certified in Node.js, React, SQLite.


I'm also an experienced professional with a demonstrated history of working in the consumer electronics industry. I have extensive Troubleshooting and Customer Experience skills acquired from time with Apple.
